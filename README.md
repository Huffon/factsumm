# FactSumm: Factual Consistency Scorer for Abstractive Summarization

`FactSumm` is a toolkit that scores *__Factualy Consistency__* for **Abstract Summarization**

Without fine-tuning, you can simply apply a variety of downstream tasks to both `the source article` and `the generated abstractive summary`

![](assets/triples.png)

For example, by extracting **fact triples** from source articles and generated summaries, we can verify that generated summaries correctly reflect source-based facts ( *See image above* )

As you can guess, this *PoC-ish* project uses a lot of pre-trained modules that require __*super-duper*__ computing resources

So don't blame me, just take it as a concept project üëÄ

<br>

## Installation

`FactSumm` requires *Java* to be installed in your environment to use **Stanford OpenIE**. With *Java* and *Python 3*, you can install `FactSumm` from source repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/huffon/factsumm
cd factsumm
pip install .
```

<br>

## Usage

```python
>>> from factsumm import FactSumm
>>> factsumm = FactSumm()
>>> article = "Lionel Andr√©s Messi (born 24 June 1987) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a forward and captains both Spanish club Barcelona and the Argentina national team. Often considered as the best player in the world and widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Messi has won a record six Ballon d'Or awards, a record six European Golden Shoes, and in 2020 was named to the Ballon d'Or Dream Team."
>>> "Lionel Andr√©s Messi (born 24 Aug 1997) is an Spanish professional footballer who plays as a forward and captains both Spanish club Barcelona and the Spanish national team."
>>> factsumm(article, summary, verbose=True)

The triple-based module counts the overlap of fact triples between the generated summary and the source document.

### QA-based Module

![](assets/qa.png)

If you ask questions about the summary and the source document, you will get a similar answer if the summary realistically matches the source document

```python
>>> from factsumm import FactSumm
>>> factsumm = FactSumm()
>>> factsumm.extract_qas(article, summary, verbose=True)
Answers based on SOURCE (Questions are generated from Summary)
[Q] Who is the captain of the Spanish national team?    [Pred] <unanswerable>
[Q] When was Lionel Andr√©s Messi born?  [Pred] 24 June 1987
[Q] Lionel Andr√©s Messi is a professional footballer of what nationality?       [Pred] Argentine
[Q] Lionel Messi is a captain of which Spanish club?    [Pred] Barcelona

Answers based on SUMMARY (Questions are generated from Summary)
[Q] Who is the captain of the Spanish national team?    [Pred] Lionel Andr√©s Messi

### OpenIE-based Module ( *open-scheme* )

```python
>>> from factsumm import FactSumm
>>> factsumm = FactSumm()
>>> factsumm.extract_triples(article, summary, verbose=True)
SOURCE Triples
('Messi', 'is', 'Argentine')
('Messi', 'is', 'professional')

SUMMARY Triples
('Messi', 'is', 'Spanish')
('Messi', 'is', 'professional')

Triple Score: 0.5
```

Stanford OpenIE can extract relationships from raw strings. But it's important to note that it's based on the open scheme, not the closed scheme (like `Triple-based Module`).

For example, from `"Obama was born in Hawaii"`, OpenIE extracts (Obama, born in Hawaii). However, from `"Hawaii is the birthplace of Obama"`, it extracts (Hawaii, is the birthplace of, Obama). In common sense, the triples extracted from the two sentences should be identical, but OpenIE can't recognize that they are the same since it is based on an open scheme.

So the score for this module may be unstable.

<br>

### ROUGE-based Module

```python
>>> from factsumm import FactSumm
>>> factsumm = FactSumm()
>>> factsumm.calculate_rouge(article, summary)
Avg. ROUGE-1: 0.4415584415584415
Avg. ROUGE-2: 0.3287671232876712
Avg. ROUGE-L: 0.4415584415584415
```

Simple but effective word-level overlap ROUGE score
