# FactSumm: Factual Consistency Scorer for Abstractive Summarization

`FactSumm` is a toolkit that scores *__Factualy Consistency__* for **Abstract Summarization**

Without fine-tuning, you can simply apply a variety of downstream tasks to both `the source article` and `the generated abstractive summary`

![](assets/triples.png)

For example, by extracting **fact triples** from source articles and generated summaries, we can verify that generated summaries correctly reflect source-based facts ( *See image above* )

As you can guess, this *PoC-ish* project uses a lot of pre-trained modules that require __*super-duper*__ computing resources

So don't blame me, just take it as a concept project ðŸ‘€

<br>

## Installation

`FactSumm` requires *Java* to be installed in your environment to use **Stanford OpenIE**. With *Java* and *Python 3*, you can install `FactSumm` from source repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/huffon/factsumm
cd factsumm
pip install .
```

<br>

## Usage

```python
>>> from factsumm import FactSumm
>>> factsumm = FactSumm()
>>> article = "Superman is a fictional superhero who first appeared in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character was created by writer Jerry Siegel and artist Joe Shuster, and first appeared in the comic book Action Comics #1. Superman has been adapted to a number of other media which includes radio serials, novels, movies, television shows and theatre. Although Superman was not the first superhero character, he popularized the superhero archetype and established its conventions. Superheroes are usually judged by how closely they resemble the standard set by Superman. He was the best-selling superhero character in American comic books up until the 1980s."
>>> summary = "Superman is a fictional superhero who first appeared in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was created by writer Jerry Siegel and artist Joe Shuster. He popularized the superhero archetype and established its conventions. Superman has been adapted to a number of other media which includes radio serials, novels, movies, television shows and theatre."

The triple-based module counts the overlap of fact triples between the generated summary and the source document.

### QA-based Module

If you ask questions about the summary and the source document, you will get a similar answer if the summary realistically matches the source document

```python
>>> from factsumm import FactSumm
>>> factsumm = FactSumm()
>>> article = "Son Heung-min is a South Korean professional footballer who plays as a forward for Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur and captains the South Korea national team."
>>> summary = "Son Heung-min is a American professional footballer who plays for Tottenham Hotspur."
>>> factsumm.extract_qas(article, summary, verbose=True)
[Q] Who is the name of the professional footballer who plays for Tottenham Hotspur?     [Ent] Son Heung - min   [Pred] Son Heung-min
[Q] What nationality is Son Heung-min?  [Ent] American  [Pred] South Korean
[Q] What team does Son Heung-min play for?      [Ent] Tottenham Hotspur [Pred] Tottenham Hotspur

Answers based on SUMMARY (Questions are generated from Summary)
[Q] Who is the name of the professional footballer who plays for Tottenham Hotspur?     [Ent] Son Heung - min   [Pred] Son Heung-min
[Q] What nationality is Son Heung-min?  [Ent] American  [Pred] American

Stanford OpenIE can extract relationships from raw strings. But it's important to note that it's based on the open scheme, not the closed scheme (like `Triple-based Module`).

For example, from `"Obama was born in Hawaii"`, OpenIE extracts (Obama, born in Hawaii). However, from `"Hawaii is the birthplace of Obama"`, it extracts (Hawaii, is the birthplace of, Obama). In common sense, the triples extracted from the two sentences should be identical, but OpenIE can't recognize that they are the same since it is based on an open scheme.

So the score for this module may be unstable.

### ROUGE-based Module

```python
>>> from factsumm import FactSumm
>>> factsumm = FactSumm()
>>> article = "Son Heung-min is a South Korean professional footballer who plays as a forward for Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur and captains the South Korea national team."
>>> summary = "Son Heung-min is a American professional footballer who plays for Tottenham Hotspur."
>>> factsumm.calculate_rouge(article, summary)
Avg. ROUGE-1: 0.5714285714285714
Avg. ROUGE-2: 0.3846153846153846
Avg. ROUGE-L: 0.5714285714285714
```

Simple but effective word-level overlap ROUGE score
